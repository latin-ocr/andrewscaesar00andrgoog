’ A Harmony of the Four Gospels‚ in English, accord-

ing to the common version3 newly arranged, with Explanatory Notes. By
Enwluzn Romxson, D. D., LL. D.

The object os this work is to obtain a full and consecutive account of all the
facts of our Lord's life and ministry. In order to do this, the four gospel nar-
rativcs have been so brought to ether, as to present as nearly as⁴ possible the
tfue chronological order, and wfiere the same transaction is described by more
than one writer, the different accounts are placed side by side, so as to fill out
and supply each other. Such an arrangement affords the only full and erfect
survey of all the testimony relating tq any and every portion of our Lor 's his-

tory. The eva elists are thus mane their own best inte reters3 and it is
Ὓη-ῂϊπιξὲωῐὶῶγῖῐωγ are sup lementary to each ot er in minute as
011 as in important articulars, an in this way is brought out fully and

clearlv the fundamen characteristics of their testimony, unity in diversity.
To Bible classes, Sabbath schools, and all who love and seek the truth in their

. closets and in their familieS, this work will be found a useful assistant.

my own mind, is a conviction of the great merite of this work, and its adaptation to im-
part the highest life and interest to Bible 01000 examines, and generally to the diligent

stud of the Gospel. Itis much to be desired that every one accustomed to sesi-ming
the rlptures should have this invaluable aid.—Rev. Dr. Skinner, New Yorlc.
