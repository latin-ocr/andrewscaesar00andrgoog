NEW SERIES OF LATIN SCHOOL BOOKS.

Ι have adopted the Latin Grammar of Andrews and Stoddard in the school under my
charge, believlng it better 00001011, upon the whole, for elementary instruction than any
similar work which 1 have examined. It combines the improvements of the meent Ger-
man works 00 1110 subJect with the best features of that old favor-ite of the schools‚ Dr.
Adam's Latin eremman--Hemy Dn'sler. Professor qt* Latin in alumbia Collega.

A careful review of the Revised Edition ol Andrews 0οᾱ Stoddard’s latin Grammar,
shows that this favorite text-book still continues to deservo the affections and confidence
of Teachers and PupUs, incorporating 0011 does the results of Prof. Andrews' own con·
stant study for many years with the investigatione of Rnglish and German Philologists.
No other Grammar is now 00 well fitted to meet the wants ot the country as the rapu
demand for it will show beyond doubt—A. S. Hartweu, University qf St. Leuis.

This Grammar of the Latin langueas. now universally pronounced the verybest, 10
greatly improved by the corrections, revisions and additions or this 10110οᾱ edition. We
do not believe a text-book was ever written which introduced 00 great an improvement
10 the ,method of teaching Latin, as this has done. We wish the revised edition the
greatest success, which we are sure it merita—Rhode Island Schoolmaster.

1 have examined our revised edition with considerable care, and do not hesitate to
pronounce it a great mprovement upon the old editions, and as near perfection as we
are likely to have. 1 have no doubt it will come into general usa—A. Wuiams, meessor
of Latin, Jefferson Col-lege, Ganonsbmffi Pa.

Ι ha've been much inter-ested in the Revised Edition. 'I’he improvement is very strikiu ‚
and 1 shall no longer think of giving it up and putting Zumpt 111 110 01000. Ι am muc
leased with the great improvement in the typography. You have given to our schools a
Book fifty per cent better in every respect, and 1 trust ,ou will have your reward in
largely increased sales.—William J. Rozse, Mater of oli High School, Lawrence, Ms.

1 can with much leasure say that your Grammar seems to.me much better adapted
to the present con tion and wants of our 00110010 than any one with which Ι am ac·
01101111οᾱ, and to supply that which has long been wanted—a good 10110 Grammar for
common usa—F. Gar-dm, Principaz of Boston Latin School.

The latin Grammar of Andrews and Stoddard is deserving‚ 10 my opinion, of the ap·
probation which 00 many of our ablest 10000010 have bestowed upon it. It is beliemd
that, of all the grammars before the public, this has greatly the advantage, in
both to the excellence of its arran ment, and the accur-acy and copiousness of 11010101-
matione-115 Β. nactam, Prof. of ibcicca mactare in Newton Theological Seminary.

The universal favor with which this Grammar is received was not unexpected. It will

bear a thorough and discriminating examination. In the use of well-defined and ex

ressive 101100, ospedany in 1110 syntax, we know of· no Latin or Greek grammar which
E to be compared 10 thia—Ammona Quarterly Regma.

These works will furnish a series of elementary publicatione for the study or Latin
altogether in advance or any thin which has hitherto appeared, either in this country
or in lingnam-American Bibli Repositmy.

1 cheerfully and decidedly bear testimony to the superior excellence of Andrews and
Stoddard's Latin Grammar to any manual of the kind with which 1 am acquainted.
Δ Bvery part bears the impress of a carerul compilet. The principles of syntax are happily

developed 111 the rules. whilst those relating to the moods and tenses supply an important

deiicieucy in our former-Cg'rnmmars. The rules of prosody are also clearly and fully ex·
hibited'.-Rev. Lyman teman, Mmchester, Vt.

This work bears evident marks or great care and 011111, and ripe and accurate scholar-
‘gssoaetgff authors. We cordially commend it to the student and toacher.—Biblical

Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin Grammar is what 1 expected it would be—an excellent
book. We cannot hesitate 0 moment 10 laying aside the books now- in 000, and intro-
‹laniagnam—Rev. J. Panum, D. D.‚ New Yorlc.

Andrews and Stoddard’s 110110 Grammar bears throughout evidence of original and
thorough investigation and sound criticism. It is, in my apprehension‚ so 1111 as sim-
plicity is concerned, on the one hand, and philosophical views and sound scholarship on
the other, tar preferable 1ο 011101 grammars; a work at the same time highly creditable to

· its authors and to our munem—Professor Δ. euchata, Bowaeoin 011110εο, Μαίη.

1 do 001 hesitate to pronounce Andmws'aud Stoddard's Latin Grammar superior to
any other with which Ι am acquainted. 1 have never 0000, ῗὲῐπὴοᾝ greater amount

We have no hesitation 10 pronouncing this Grammar decidedly superior to any now
111 uno.—Boston Baton-dor.
