On the death os Julia and Crassus, the dimembled friendship which
had for some time existed between Caesar and Pompey, gave place to
persona} hatred and open hostility. N either of these generals could bear
an equal, much less a superior. Through the influence ot' Pompey, the
senate had received Caesar’s petitions with contemptuous indifference,
which was with him a good reason for involving his country in all the
horrors of intestine bloodsbed. Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon, the bound-
ary of Gallia Cisalpina, which the laws did not allow him to pass while
in command, was an actual declaration of hostilities. Pompey and his
friends ssed from Italy, and crossed over to Greece. In sixty dayS, Caesar
conquered all Italy, entered Rome, and took possession of the treasury,
which Pompey, hy an unaccountable oversight, had lest behind him, Hav-
ing seized the public treasure, he left the command of the army in Italy to
Antony, and went against Pompey's best troops, which were then in Spain
under Petreius, Afranius and Varro, observing, on his quitting the capi·

tal, ‘⁸ that he was going to light an army without a general, and would re· ⁶

turn to fight a general without an army.'’ He was well received by the
inhabitants os all the towns on his road thither, except the people os Mar·
seille-5, who refused to admit him within their gates. Unwilling to speud
much time in the reduction of that city, he gave the command of the
troops who were to attack it by land, to Trebonius, his lieutenant-general,
and of the ficet to Decimus Brutus. Having brought the war in Spain to
a successful termination, on his return to Rome he compelled the inhab-
itants of Marseilles, after a long and brave resistance, to surrender. He
then prepared to follow Pompey into Greece, conscious that during his
life he should enjoy neither tranquillity nor security. After several
skirmishes, the two armies came to a decisive engagement on the plain
of Pharsalia, in which Pompey was completely defeated and his camp
taken. Immediately after that disastrous battle, Pompey hastened, ⁴
with only thirty horsemen, to the shores of the Archipelago, and after- ”
wards fied to ngpt, where he was murdered. Caesar, resolving to pur·

tue his enemy into whatever part of ” the world he might go, followed him
into Egypt, which he reached soon atter the murder of Pompey. Em·

bracing the interest of Cleopatra, Caesar became attached to her person,
and for some time the character os the conqueror was lost in that of the
voluptuary.

Having placed the crown of Egypt on the head of Cleopatra, with
whom he had associated in the kingdom her younger brother Ptolemy,
he advanced with her up the Nile, and would probably have gone to
Ethiopia, had not his soldiers refused to follow him. Roused at last from
his indolence and effeminacy by the revolt of Pharnaces, king of Pontus,
lie marched against that monarch, defeated him, and subdued his country,
with such ease and rapidity, that in writing an account of it to a friend
at Rome, he employed only three words, Veni, vidi, vici. To Mithridates,
stom whom he had received uo much assistance in the Alexandrina war, he
