gave the kingdom of Bosphorus, on the sea of Azoph, and entrusted
Domitius with the settlement of other affairs in Asia. To quell the som-
motions in Italy, he returned to „that country, levying great contributions
ὧι· the African war from the states through which he passed. The good
fortune of Caesar did not fail him in this expedition3 he defeated the re-
publican forces under Scipio, in an« engagement near Thapsus, and re-
duced the kingdom of their ally, J uba, king of Mauritania, to a Roman
province. On hearing of Caesar’s success», Cato killed himself at Utica.
Returning to Rome, Caesar‚ at the interval of a few da yS‚ triumphed four
different times, in consequence of his having conquered Gaul, Egypt,
Pontus and Africa. ·

The plunder of so many countries enabled the conqueror of the world
to glut his soldiers with presents‚ and the citizens with largesses. To
dazzle the eyes of the multitude, and to divert the minds of the citizens from
the extinction of their liberties, he exhibited shows os uncommon mag·
nificence, and gave feasts of the most unbounded profusion. He also en·
acted some useful lawS, and regulated the calendar according to the course
of the sun.

Cneius and Sextus, the sons of Pompey, aided by Labienus, having
drawn together a powerfui army in Spain, Caesar was again obliged to
leave Rome, and march against them„ They came to a decisive battle at
Munda, in which the former two displayed great heroism and generalship.
The veterans of Caesar were forced to fly, and it required all his addi-ess
to bring them again to the charge. Victory at last declared in his favor,
which put a final period to the war, and lest the conqueror in the

were now opened. Though his triumph surpassed in splendor and mag·
nificence all that had ever been seen in Rome, the people, with sorrowful
beartS, gazed at the pompous procession, and stood silent. No acclama-
tion followed the car of the conqueror. The splendid exhibition was be-
held as the final extinction of Roman independence‚ and the commence-
ment of degrading slavery. The citizens J'ustly considered Caesar, as
triumphing, not over the natives of Spain, but over the sons os Pompey,
their favorite general, over the nobles of Rome, and over the laws of the
commonwealth. ‚

The senate has been blamed for conferring such extravagant honors,
and for bestowing such unlimited power on Caesam but in this they
merely granted what they had then no power to withhold. They elected
him consul every year, and dictator for life3 appointed him superintendent
of public moraIS, and conferred upon him the title os imperator and father
os his country. They decreed him an elevated seat in the theatre, a gold·
en chair in the senate-house and on the tribunal in·the forum. To complete
their extravagance and impiety, they voted templeS‚ altars, and priests, to
the man who had destroyed their constitution, and enslaved his fellow-
citizens. The command os the army, disposal os the treasury, and nom·
