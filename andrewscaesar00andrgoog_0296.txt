ination os the magistrates, he considered to be put in his power by the
success of his arms3 hence the concurrence of the senate in these'ma tters
was deemed unnecessary. It must nat be denied that his conduct, when
supreme commander, was marked with great clemeney‚ and that he ena
acted several salutary laws sor the better regulation of the state. He
administered justice without partiality, and added to the greatness of the
empire by planting Roman colonies beyond seaS. But his elevated sta-
tion, as well as the measures by which it had been obtained, created him
enemies; and the principa! senators, among whom was his most intimate
friend Brutus, conspired against his life. He died in the senate-house, on
the l5th of March, 44 B. C.‚ in the fisty-sixth year os his age, pierced by
twenty-three wounds, after he had enjoyed the peacesul possession os the
empire only five months.

Os Caesar’s intrepidity as a soldier, and abilities as a commander, the
armies which he defeated, and the countries which he conquered, are
sufficient proofs. To the talents os a consummate general, he added those
of an elegant historian and a persuasive orator. Much of his Commen-
taries is said to have been composed on the spot where his battles were
fought. The purity and neatness of his style, notwithstanding the rapidity
with which he must have written, have not been surpassed by any Ro-
man writer. His narrative is perspicuouS, simple, and natural. J t is at
once chaste and animated. His lucid and pieturesque description places
the whole scene distinctly before the reader‚ who accompanies him in all
his marc-hes, and is a witness of every engagement. F'ew passages oc·
cur in his writingS, which the most illiterate do not understand, and the
most polished do not approve. It would be absurd to expect in the Com-
mentaries a finished history. They are mere outlineS, which he, perhapS.
entertained the hope of seeing filled up, either by himself, or by some
other hand.

Resides a few juvenile pieces, mentioned by SuetoniuS, and a collec-
tion of apophtheng, Caesar lest, at his death, two books on grammar, and
a poem which he called Iter, or The Journey. But these, with his let-
ters to the senate and to his friends, are now lost. N one of his writings
now remain, except seven books of the Gallie and three of the civil war.

Os Caesar’s talents as an orator, we have the opinion of Cicero and
Quintilian. His orations were admired for two qualities, not always
united, strength and elegance. Cicero places him among the first orators,
and Quintilian asserts that he spoke with the same spirit with which he
fought. Had not ambition, says that great critic, diverted Caesar {rom
the arts of peace, he would have rivaled the eloquence os Cicero.
