Robinson’s Hebrew Lexicon. Sixth ition, Revised
and Stereo ed. A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the ld Testament, in·
cluding the iblical Chaldee. Translated from the Latin oi* william GesenIus,
late Professor of Theolo in the Universi of Helle-wittember . Bv Enwmn
Boumelos, D. D.‚ LL. . Professor of 131 110a1 Literature in e Union The-
ological Seminary‚ New York. A new edition, with corrections and la e ad-
ditions, partly furnished by the author in manuscript, a} partly con ensed
from his larger Thesaurus as compiled by Boediger. Th sse-corrections and
additions were made by br. Gesenius during an interval of seve years,
while carrying his Thesaurus through the press and were transcribe and fur-
nished by him expressly for this edition. They will be found to be very

numerous, ever page having been materfafly corrected ΩΜἫ

Dr. Robinson had already been trained to the business of lexicographieal labor, when
he began the translation of the present work. He is, in an uncoqmon degree, master
of his own native tongue. He has diligence, patience, perseveran ea, the iron dili·
gent-e of Gesenius himself. For aught that 1 have yet been able to ver all that can
reasonably be expected or desired, has been done by the translator ‚suot oniy as to ren-
dering the work into English, but as to the manner and the accur-acy of printing. The
work will speak‘for itself, on the first opening. It does honor, in its rauce, to edi-
tor, printers, and publishers. 1 have only to add my hearty wish, t t its beautiful
white peges may be consulted and turned over, until they become thoroughly worn with

the hands of the purchasers.—Prqfi Stuart, in tae Biblical Repository.

, There is no lexicon in English that can be put on a level with Robinson’s. Ι recommend
the present as the best Iaexicon of the Hebrew and Biblical omlnes which an English
scholar can have-Rev. Dr. Samuel David-son, qf landon. '

Gesenius’ Lexicon is known wherever Hebrew is studied. On the merite of this work
criticism has' long ago pronounced its verdict of approval.—London Jewisk Chronica.

This is a very beautiful and complete edition of the best Hebrew Ijexieon ever yet
produced. aesonius, as a Hebrew philologist, is unequalled.-London clerica} Journa-

'l'his is decidedl the most complete edition of Gesenius’ Manual Hebrew lexicon.-

This work of Ξ .·. Robinson confines itself to the legitimate sphere of a Harmony of tho
Gospels3 and we do not hesitate to say thatin this sphere it will be found to be au· that
a Harmony need mucan be. 'l'hq original text is printed with accuracy and eleg-auce
It is a feast to the eyes to look upon a page of so much beauty. Its arrangement is dis·
tinguished for simplicity. and convenience. No one will ever be able to comprehend the
relations of the Gospele to each other, or acquire an exact knowledge of their contente,
unless he studies them with the aid of a Harmony. The present work furnishee in this
respect Just the facility which is needed; and we trust that among its other effecte, it

will serve to direct attention more strongly to the importance oi· this mode of etudy.—
