NEW SERIES OF LATIN SCHOOL BOOKS.

1 have reason to believe that the improvements‚·introduced into the last edition of
Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin Grammar by my respecmd and lamented friend Dr. An·
drews, a little before his death, add very decidedly to the value of a work, which 1133
done more to give the knowledge of that language to the youth of this country than any,
perhaps than all others.— Theodora W. Woolsey, presidem qs Yale Gouege, New Haven.

No book, probably, has done more to impl-ove classical treining in American school·
than Andrews and Stoddard’s [Attin Grammar. Its use is almost universam and where it
has not itself been adopted as a manual, it has made grammars ο1· similar excellence
necessary. The last edition, the sixty-firth, was carefully revised by the lamented Dr.

Grammar of Professor Zumpt. It will therefore be found to be much im roved as a re-
pository of the principles and facts ο1· the latin language.—- Thomas A. T loer, Profes-
sor os Latin in Yale Collega, New Haven..

It is unnecessary to commend a‘Letin. Gramma, which has been for twenty years in
common use in our Colleges, and has generally superseded all others. The Revised

‘¹ Edition contains the results ο1“ the labore of Dr. Andrews, during all that time, on va· ,

rious Latin Classics and on his great Latin Iaexicon3 and cannot, therefore, but be
tly improved—hliuma Robinson, D. D.‚ LL. D.‚ Prof. of Biblieal Lim-amre in

iem Tlieol. Seminary, New York· city.

Ι regard Andrews’ and Stoddard’s new Latin Grammar, as an exceedingly valnaer
work. It evidently contains the results ot the Author’s careful and long continued in·
vestigation, and from itz fulness, clearness, and accurs-cy, will undoubtedly become the
standard Latin Grammar of this Continent. In Western New York, we have for a long
time been using the earlier editions, and they have rapidly won upon the public regard.
'l'his new edition will give it a stronger claim upon our favor. It must rapidly super-

sede all others. Ι can unhesitatingly recommend the New Grammar as the best in use.—
Laewis H. ccarlc, Principat of Sodus Academy, Wayne Go., N. Y.

Ι have looked over the new edition of the Grammar with great interest. Itis now
eighteen years since 1 introduced it into this college, and 1 have never felt inclined to
change it for any other. The revision, without changing its general character, has added
greatly to its fulness and completeness. It is now fully equal to Zumpt's in these re·

- spects, and far superior to it in adaptatIon to the class room. There is no other school

grammar that can pretend to compare with it. 1 have introduced the new edition here,
. and have no idea Ι ,shall ever wish 1ο substitute another. 'Phe servit& ο1· Prof. Andrewe

111 the cause of classical learning in the United States cannot be over estimatae—M. Stur-
gus, Prcffessor in Hanover college, Indiam ‘

Ι 3111 willing to say that 1 am decidedly in favor ot Andrews’ Latin Seriee.— Geo. Gaze,
Galesviue University, Wisconsin.

Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin Grammar Ι consider decidedly the best utin Grammar
ever published.—Ransom Noreon, North Livermore. .Maine.

Such a work as Andrews and Stoddard's Revised Latin Grammar needs no recommend-
ztliezn-brilt' ffiiaks for izoem-A. A. Keen, meessor os Greek and Latin, thfcs college,

Ι have examined the revised edition of Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin Grammar, and
think it a complete success. Ι see it has all 01· Zumpt’s merits and none of his derecte,
and welcome its advent with great measure-dames M. Whiton, Hopkins Grammar
school, New Haven, Gonu. >

1 have examined Andrews and Stoddard's Latin Grammar, and say, without hesita-
tion, that the principles of the Latin language can be more easily and systematically
acquired from it than any work 1 have ever seen. The arrangement and simplicity 01· 113
tenus are such as to make it easily comprehended by the beginner, while. at the same
time. its copiousness is sufficient for the most advanced student. The author has evi-
dently noted and profited b the desecte in this respect of most of the Latin (ξι-3111111313
now in use.—- C. W. Field, h'Clumlc, Pa.

The». superior merits of the original work are too well known and appreciated to need
any commendation from me. 1 have had some means of knowing how great pains and
labor Dr. Andrews has bestowed upon this final revision and improvement of the work,
and, therefore, was not unprepared to find its acknowledged excellence materially in-
creased, and Ι do not hesitate to say that its value has been greatly enhanced‚ and that
lt has been brou ht as near as practicable to the present state of philological seleuce.—
Jolm D. ΡΙιίΖὸτ-ἰεῖ, Superintendent qs Public Schools, city of Boston.

I have looked the Grammar through with much care and a great degree of satisfactioni,
and I unhesitatingly pronounce it superior to any latin Grammar in method and man·
ner ο1· discussion, and happily adapted to the wants of both teachers and pupils-J. W.
Sananda, Principal <ff New England Christian Instituta, Anam-er, N. H.
