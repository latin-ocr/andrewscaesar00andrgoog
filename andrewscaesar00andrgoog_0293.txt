urs 012· CAESAR. 309

of the other two, and that of Caesar, by occasionally yielding to Pompey's
farne, to raise his own, “ and crown his mad ambition.’'

From this period the state was wholly managed by Caesar3 and the vio-
- lence of his proceedings rendered the triumviri objects os just abhorrence
to' all classes os the community. Cicero, to whom Pompey contessed he
had been duped by Caesar. advised him to break off all connection with that
intriguing and unprincipled politician ; but with him the winning address
oi· Caesar had more influence, who not only preserved their former inti·
macy, in opposition to the advice of Cicer0, but strengthened their union
by giving Pom pey, in marriage, his daughter J ulia a woman of the most
amiable disposition, and ot the most engaging mmanners So great was
her influence with both her father and husband, thatin spite of the mutual
Jealousy and aversion which were afterwards manifested between them,
she prevented their coming to any rupture as long as she lived. To increase
his power in the state, and to command the interest of Piso, who succeeded
him in the consulship, he married his daughter Calpurnia. A strong and
respectable party, animated by love of their country, then began warmly
to oppose the measures os the triumvirate. Caesar, anxious to intimidate
them, bribed Vettius», who had formerly preferred an accusation against
himself, to declare, that he had been urged by some of the nobles to as·
sassinate Pompey: but this villany‚ being detected by the people, was
treated with such contempt, that he was glad to drop it; and to prevent
discovery he put Vettius to death in prison. 'Notwithstanding these acts
of enormity, he still retained a very powerful party in the state. Previ-
ously to the expiration of his consulship, he obtained from the people
through his agent, the tribune Vatinius, the province os Gallia Cisalpina
and Illyricum‘with three legions for five years; and the senate, at the
desire os Oaesar, added Gallia Transalpina and another legion. These
legions were gradually increased to thirteen. Some of the succeeding
magistrates wished to annul his acm, and to prosecute him for his illegal
conduct during his consulship ; but having· the tribunes in his interest, a
veto was put on all their proceedingS.

Caesar is supposed to have set out for Gaul in the end of March, B. C.
58. Os his conquestos that country, checking the inroads of the Ger-
mans, and overrunning a part of Britain, the Commentaries of the Gallio
War contain a rapid but well written account. The young reader must
not infer, that all his engagements with these nations are fully recorded,
or that every circumstance of his conduct with regard to them is either
minutely or faithfully detailed. Respect for his character as a man in-
duced him to conceal many particulam, and to hint at rather than' describe
others. His cruelty and injustice in attacking the states in alliance with
Rome, called forth merited reprehension in the senate, where it was even

⁴ , proposed, that, for his abuse os power in that country, he should be given

up to the enemy; but the splendor of his success prevented that motion
from passing into a laW.
