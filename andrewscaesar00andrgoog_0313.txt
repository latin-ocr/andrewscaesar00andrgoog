His responsis. The English idiom often admits the singular number,
by regarding a number os particular things as constituting one whole,
where the Latin idiorn requires the plural. As here “this reply;'’ so
below, liis mandatis, ““this messagess'

In carisiolam suo. Caesar was consul the year before, i. e., A. U. C. 695.

Hanc gratiam referret. This is said ironically, instead of tam male gra·

Illis, sc. AEduis. See chap. 31.

Si id ita fecisset. Either id „or ita would seem to be sufficient, but a
similar redundance is osten found in the writings os Caesar. Fecisset, sc.
is, i. e., Ariovistus.

Si non impetraret, sc. Caesar. The subject is changed though not ex·
pressed. Instead of impetraret, the general principles of the language
seem to require impetrasset, Gr. ς 266, 2, R. 4.

M Messala M. Pismoe Coss. This was A. U. Ο. 693, three years before.

Provinciam obtineret. 'Phe provinces were assigned to the consuls by
lot.

Quod—facere posset, ‘⁴ so sar as he could do it,’' Gr. ς) 264, 3.

sentence, quomam M Messala, etc. AEduomm, an objective genitive.

XXXVI The reply of Ariovistu- to Caenun
Ad Iiaec, “to t'his.” See note on liis responsis, chap. 35.

Ad suum arbitrium. Suus here refers to the subject of its own clause,
according to the general rule, Gr. ᾗ 208, without regard to the principle
in ὑ 208, (1,) and in§ 266, R. 3. This is not uncommon.

Uteretur, sc. populus Romanus, Gr. ὦ 209, Β.. 2, (1.) (b.) ⁸‘ how to use.''

Sese-a populo Romano in suojure, Gr. ᾗ 266, Β.. 3.

Se obsides reddiburum non esse, “that he should not.'' Nomen populi

is denoted by both redditurum and afuburum.

fraternum nomen popuii Romani, i. e., the name os brothers given to
them (the AEdui) by the Romans.

Quod sibi Caesar denunciant. “ In regard to Caesar’s threatening him,”
or “though Caesar threatened him.” Quod, in this sense, serves the pur·
pose of a conjunction, but is, originally and properly, a relative, Gr.
ime, <¹4-› ⁴

Sibi—se-secum—sua. Sibi relates to AriovistuS, se to Caesar, secum to
Ariovistus, and sud to neminem. Sibi, se, and seem, are in conformity
with Gr. ᾖ 208, (1,) since quod sibi Caesar denunciaret, and neminem secum

’ sine sud pernicie contendisse, is the language of Ariovistus, and se AEduo·

rum injurias vum neglecturum is that of Caesar. In oratio directa the last
clause would be, nemo mcum sine sud pernicie contendit, and in the oratio
obliqua the reflexive has remained anchanged, Gr. ὑ 208, (6,) (ι’.)
