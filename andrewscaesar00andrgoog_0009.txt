Aster a due examination, Ι am happy to state that the Anthor hes admirably accom-
plished the objects which he aimed at in making this last revision. He has added much
that is in the highest degree valuable without materially changing the arrangement of
the original work. The work appears to me well adapted to the daily use of our Clusi·
eal Schools, and Ι shall heren-fter direct my classes to use it.— C'. L. Cursum-m, Priooeipal
qt‘PeabocIy High Sclwol‚ South Danvm, Ms.

Tho Reviscd Grammar seems to me greatly improved and to be every thing a scholar
could wien—Z. Β. διανεί-ς, Οήανῑεείοωπ, Indiana. .

1 have subjected the Revised Edition to the test of actual use in the reclution roem,
and am persuaded that in its present form it decidedly sur-pasees every other latin Gram-
mar in point of adaptation to the vante of studente in our Academiee, mgh school·
and colleges.- Willtam S. naama, Genera H1gk Schooz, chamelaea, ΟΙιίο.

I think Andrews’ Series of ‘latin Works the most systematic and best arranged course 1
have ever seem—and believe ir our pupils would use‘ them altogether, tre should find
them much better scholare. 1 shall use them whony in my schoah—A. G. Stockin,
principat of Moumovslz summm, Μαίπε. ·

'l'he examination of the Revised Edition hae afforded me very great pleneme, and lead·
me to express the deep and sincere conviction that it is the most complete Grammar of
the Latin language with which 1 am acquainted‚ and best adnpoed for ready consultation

Ι flnd the Revised Edition to be just what is needed for a Iatin Grammar‚-clear, com·
rehensive‚ yet concise, in the subject matter, 1 shall introduce it as a permanent text·

1 have carefully examined your Revised Edition throughout, particularly the Correo-
tions and Additions. It now appears to me all that can be desired. It seems like part·
ing with a familiar friend ιο lay aeide the old edition, with its many excellencies, and
adopt the new„ bnt Ι shall cheerfully make the sacrifice for the greater benefit that will
ecci-ue to those commencing the study of Latin from time ιο tima-J. H. ardeam, Prin-
cipaz os Northfield Institution, Vermpnt. ¹ τ

1 thought before that the old edition was entitled to the appellatiou ot “ The Latin
(Ji-amman„ but I perceive its value has been much increased by the numerous emenda·
tione and additions of Pros. Andrews. 'l'he Grammar is nov fitted ιο be a complete
hand-gaook for ffeypatin scholar during his whole course—E. W Johnson, Canum Acad-
emy‚ mon, . .

1 unhesitatingly prononnce the Revised Edition of Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin
Gramma the best Grammar of the Latin Language, and shall certainly use my influence
in its be alt—H. Ε. J. Glute, Edinboro', Pa.

After a thorough examination, Ι have no hesitation in prononncing it the beet Latin
Grammar for the purposes ‘of the recitation room that 1 have ever examined. In its
present form it ought certainly to displace a large majority of the Grammars in common
use. Its rules of Syntax are expressed with accuracy and precisum, and are in fact
what all mles ought to be, reliable guides' ιο the learner.—James W. Andrews, Principe}
qs Hopeweu Amanum Penn.

Andrews and Stoddard’s Iatin Grammar, in the arrangement and adaptation ιο the
learner, has excelled all others, and the revised edition is certainly a great improvement,
and 1 do believe is better adapted to the wants of the student than any other. 'l'he
whole seems ιο be critically revised and corrected. Prof. Andrews was truly the stu·
dent's benewwr.—M. L. &verane-e, North Τνοῃ, Vermone.

It gives me great pleasure to bear my testimony ιο the superior merite of the Latin
Grammar edifed by Professor Andrews and Mr. Stoddard. 1 express most cheerfully,
unhesitatingly, and decidedly, my preference of this Grammar ιο that or Adam which
ἅμα, for so long a time, kept almo-qt undisputed sway in, our schools.-Dr. 0. Beck, Gam-

ge.

1 know of no Grammar published in this count ‚ which promises to answer so well ·
the purposes of elementary classical instruction, an shall be glad ιο see it introduced
meo our best schools.- Charta Κ. Dillaway, Boston.

Your new Latin Grnmmar appears to me much better suited ιο the use ot studente
than any other grammar 1 am acquainted with.—Prqf. Wm. M. Hellana, Kamara, Oe
