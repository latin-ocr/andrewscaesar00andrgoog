crucifixion. After his return to Rome, he was, by the vote os the people,
appointed a military tribune. He afterwards obtained the officae of quaes-
tor, aedile, high-priest‚ praetor, and consul. During bis quaestorship his
wife Cornelia and his aunt J ulia, the widow of Marius, died 3 and he
delivered a funeral oration from the rostra in honor of both. He then mar·
ried Pompeia, the daughter os Q.. Pompeius, and grand-daughter of Sylla.
To gain the favor of the people, when an aedile, he ‘surpassed all his pre·-
decessors in the extravagance and magnificence of his shows. To dazzle
and captivate the multitude, and to wmken the power of the nobleS, was
his constant aim. The success ot' his military enterprises rendered him
a favorite with the army, and his profuse bribery secured in his interest
the populace of Rome. That his object, from his early yearS, had been
his own aggrandizement on the ruin os his country, is manifest from his
having been concerned, first, in the conspiracy of Crassus and Sylla, and
afterwards, in that of Catiline.· The judgment which he gave in the sen-
ate, wtih respect to the punishment os Lentulus, CetheguS, etc„ accom-
plices os Catiline, the conduct ot the Roman equiteS, who guarded the
temple where the senate had met, and his being arraigned asan associate
of that rebel before the quaestor and the senate, sufficiently prove both the
public opinion and his guilt, He leagued with these trait01s, not to pro-
mote their schemes,'but by their means to destroy the liberties of his
country, and become the unlimited sovereign of Rome.

The senate seem to have been apprehensive os the power and influ-
ence os Caesar by the time he was elected consul, which induced them
to decree provinces os little importance to the consuls for that year. This
provoked his resentment‚ and he labored to effect a reconciliation between
Pompey and Crassus, which he at last, after great exer-tion, accomplished.
The interest os the former he had keenly supported in the passing of the
Manilian laW, which conferred extraordinary powers on that commander,
and likewise on other occasionS, though not without an ultimate view to
his own advantage. Whatever power, beyond what was usual, had been
assigned to otherS, served as a precedent for his soliciting the like for
himself. With Crassus, a man of prodigious wealth, but of no great
personal merit, hc had long been in habits of friendship. Os all the Ro-
man citizens,'Pbmpey possessed the greatest power, Crassus the greatest
richeS, and Caesar the greatest abilitieS. In this coalition, which was in
fact a conspiracy against the liberties ol‘ Rome, they solemnly swore that
nothing was to be done in the state but by their common consent. The
combination of ¹these three great men was called the first triumvir-ate. Os
the three, Pompey was the least criminal. He appears to have been duped
by the insinuating addrcss of Caesar, in whose consulship he expected to
get his acts in Asia ratified. The decree could only gratify his vanity‚ .
which was his ruling passion ς but the means, which he employed to accom-
plish it, were highly criminal. The* object of Crassus was to add to his
wealth, and to increase his influence in the state, by the power and talenta
