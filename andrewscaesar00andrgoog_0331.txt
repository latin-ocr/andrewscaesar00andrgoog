Tigna bina sesquipedalia. The bridge was supported by tigna, ‘⁸ posts ”
or “piles,” of which those placed on the upper side sloped down the
stream, while those upon the lower side sloped up the stream. These
posts were proportioned to the depth of the river in its various parts, and
the lower extremity was driven into the earth at the bottom of the river,
while the other extremity projected above the water. Each pair os posts
was so united as to leave only sufficient space between them sor inserting
the cross, beam, trabs bipedalis, which connected them with the correspond-
ing pair of posts· on the opposite side of the bridge. The interval be-
tween the upper and lower sets of poste, constitutine the breadth os the
nridge, was forty feet.

Machinationibus. These machines are evidently different from the
fistucoes the former appear to have been employed in placing the posts
in their proper position, the latter in driving them into the earth.

sublim modo, “like a pile.'’ The common pile here spoken os was
driven perpendicularly into the earth, but that mentioned in a subsequent

part of this chapter, as connected with the lower side of the bridge, and ¹
f serving as a prop or shore, appears to have been placed still mcre ob-

llquely than the poste.
